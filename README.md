# BUYING-BOT

A simple bot to notify users via SMS that a product is no longer out of stock.

# Origin

The idea for this bot was born out of frustration with the so-called product 
scalpers on the internet. They either manually or programatically buy out as 
much of a product as they can in order to resell them at ludicrous prices.
I had the idea to create a bot of my own, but instead of automatically 
purchasing any products, it would only notify me via SMS that a product is
no longer out of stock so I could manually purchase it. I feel this is divorced
enough from the practices of scalpers in order to be ethically okay to do.
